# Detector Cross Sectional Drawing Measurements

The SketchUp file has a model of the detector with four section cuts that expose various views of the component. As shown in the image below, animation scenes were created to toggle between the section cuts which are made by selecting a plane or face then moving it inwards to hide the outer layers. This approach can be taken with any model in SketchUp to view inner layers and distinct angles of the 3D visualization.

The LayOut file displays the imported model from the SketchUp file with overlaying linear and angular dimensions of important parts. In SketchUp there is a button in the top tool bar to "Send to LayOut" which opens the model in LayOut. Here, you can use the dimensioning tool to add the measurements to your visualization.

Finally, the PowerPoint file outlines the step-by-step process to replicate these methods in your own models. <br />
